1.CloseProcessByName – 
This method closes the process based on its image name in the task manager. 
It returns a long value which represents the number of instances of the application
that are closed using this method. 


Example1:

'Open 3 notepad instances
SystemUtil.Run "notepad.exe"
SystemUtil.Run "notepad.exe"
SystemUtil.Run "notepad.exe"
 
'Close the notepads using the image name
iReturn = SystemUtil.CloseProcessByName("notepad.exe")
msgbox iReturn 'Returns 3 as total 3 notepads are closed



2. CloseProcessById – This method closes a process based on its Process ID and returns
 a) True if the process was closed successfully b) 
False if the process was not closed. 

Example2:

Dim pID_Notepad, pID_Excel
 
'Open notepad and excel applications
SystemUtil.Run "notepad.exe"
SystemUtil.Run "excel.exe"
 
'Find Process IDs of both the applications
pID_Notepad = Window("regexpwndtitle:=Notepad").GetROProperty("process id")
pID_Excel = Window("regexpwndtitle:=XLMAIN").GetROProperty("process id")
 
'Close both the applications
iReturn_N = SystemUtil.CloseProcessById(pID_Notepad)
iReturn_E = SystemUtil.CloseProcessById(pID_Excel)
 
msgbox iReturn_N 'Returns True
msgbox iReturn_E 'Returns True



3.CloseProcessByWndTitle – This method closes a process based on its window title
 and returns a long value that represents the number of instances of the 
applications that are closed. 

Example3:

Open notepad and excel applications
SystemUtil.Run "notepad.exe"
SystemUtil.Run "excel.exe"
 
'Close all the tasks where the window title exactly matches "Untitled - Notepad"
SystemUtil.CloseProcessByWndTitle "Untitled - Notepad", False
'Close all the tasks where the window title contains the string "Excel"
SystemUtil.CloseProcessByWndTitle "Excel", True


4.CloseDescendentProcesses – This method closes all the processes that 
are opened by QTP. It returns a long value which indicates the number of
 instances of the application that are closed using this method. 


Example4:
'Open notepad and excel applications using QTP
SystemUtil.Run "notepad.exe"
SystemUtil.Run "excel.exe"
 
'Close all the processes opened using QTP
iReturn = SystemUtil.CloseDescendentProcesses
msgbox iReturn


5:CloseProcessByHwnd – This method closes a process based on
 its window handle (The window handle can be found out using 
‘hwnd’ property). This method returns a) True – if the process is 
closed successfully, and b) False if the process is not closed.


Example5:

Dim hwnd_Notepad, hwnd_Excel
 
'Open notepad and excel applications
SystemUtil.Run "notepad.exe"
SystemUtil.Run "excel.exe"
 
'Find Handles of both the application windows
hwnd_Notepad = Window("regexpwndtitle:=Notepad").GetROProperty("hwnd")
hwnd_Excel = Window("regexpwndtitle:=XLMAIN").GetROProperty("hwnd")
 
'Close both the applications
iReturn_N = SystemUtil.CloseProcessByHwnd(hwnd_Notepad)
iReturn_E = SystemUtil.CloseProcessByHwnd(hwnd_Excel)
 
msgbox iReturn_N 'Returns True
msgbox iReturn_E 'Returns True
